# About Me
Hello! My name is **Juan Daniel Garcia Ruiz** and I'm currently a student in **Universidad de Sonora** in **Hermosillo, Sonora**.

My passions are **UI/UX Development**. I'm still learning, so things might look a bit simple for now. But in the future I would like to develop more complex interfaces that are easy to use and interactive.
